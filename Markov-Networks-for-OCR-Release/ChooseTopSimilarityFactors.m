function factors = ChooseTopSimilarityFactors (allFactors, F)
% This function chooses the similarity factors with the highest similarity
% out of all the possibilities.
%
% Input:
%   allFactors: An array of all the similarity factors.
%   F: The number of factors to select.
%
% Output:
%   factors: The F factors out of allFactors for which the similarity score
%     is highest.
%
% Hint: Recall that the similarity score for two images will be in every
%   factor table entry (for those two images' factor) where they are
%   assigned the same character value.
