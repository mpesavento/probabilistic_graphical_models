function [MEU OptimalDecisionRule] = OptimizeLinearExpectations( I )
  % Inputs: An influence diagram I with a single decision node and one or more utility nodes.
  %         I.RandomFactors = list of factors for each random variable.  These are CPDs, with
  %              the child variable = D.var(1)
  %         I.DecisionFactors = factor for the decision node.
  %         I.UtilityFactors = list of factors representing conditional utilities.
  % Return value: the maximum expected utility of I and an optimal decision rule 
  % (represented again as a factor) that yields that expected utility.
  % You may assume that there is a unique optimal decision.
  %
  % This is similar to OptimizeMEU except that we will have to account for
  % multiple utility factors.  We will do this by calculating the expected
  % utility factors and combining them, then optimizing with respect to that
  % combined expected utility factor.

  % YOUR CODE HERE
  %
  % A decision rule for D assigns, for each joint assignment to D's parents, 
  % probability 1 to the best option from the EUF for that joint assignment 
  % to D's parents, and 0 otherwise.  Note that when D has no parents, it is
  % a degenerate case we can handle separately for convenience.
