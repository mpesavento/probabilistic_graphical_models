Q1: prob that child of James & Rene has CF
1) none: 19.7
3) sandra: 22.22
2) jason: 29.88

Q2: prob that Ira has CF given
1) none: 19.7
3) ben + Robin: 23.72
2) ben: 24.75

Q3: how many parameters in genotype from parents with 3 alleles?
216 - wrong

Q4: how many parameters in the non-decoupled model?
1212 - wrong

Q5: how many parameters in the decoupled model?
139 - wrong

Q6: probability that next child has CF, given each parent have one F allele observed and neither has CF
0.5489 - wrong
0.4672

Q7: SMA, n=number of genes involved, m=number of alleles. How many parameters in table model?
O(m^(2n)) - correct, 2 alleles per gene, so O(m^2) combinations per gene, and O(M^(2*n)) for n genes

Q8: SMA, n=number of genes involved, m=number of alleles. How many parameters in table model?
O(mn) - correct

Q9: what can we infer from sigmoid net?
 -yes, gene A contributes but gene B doesnt
 -no, allele A1 and A2 make person more likely when both are present (AND is not possible without cross terms for alleles)
 -no, allele A1 OR A2 make person more likely (OR is not possible without cross terms)
 -yes, alleles A1 and B1 each independently make a person more likely
 -yes, A1 more likely B1 less likely (possible by using weights)
 -no, A1 & B2, or A2 & B1 (XOR)
 -yes, neither gene A nor B contribute to SMA


Q10: spinalMuscularAtrophyBayesNet
1) no observations: 22.02
2) ira + robin both have at least 1 M allele: 33.99
3) ira + robin both have at least 1 M allele and 1 B allele: 68.94

Q11: prob that ira has SMA, given that James and Robin have it
0.3541 - correct
